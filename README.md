================
We are JCK Entertainment a online entertainment website, founded in 2013 we decided to do something no one else has done, something quite unique, show cinema movies online 30 days after there general release.

I have worked within the cinema industry for over 10 years and went from being a usher to being a projectionist in 2 years, i have seen it go from film reels to digital projectionist, and have always wondered whats next in the film industry.

This i believe is the next step, to release cinema movies online, we have already started the process with our new coming soon page, which features as a cinematic teaser trailer advertising something big for next summer you can view it here at www.jckentertainment.com

The entertainment website itself is something quite new, with menus to include box office (cinema releases only) movies (every other movie thats been released on blu ray and dvd) and also soundtracks, with an online store that will allow people from all over the world to buy, sell and trade in there used dvds, blurays, and games where you can either get a online credit to shop online (includes being able to use that credit for membership purchases to watch movies) or you can get cash directly transferred into you bank account, paypal, or Google checkout.

we are currently negotiating with over 20 film studios and have 3 studios interested already 20th century fox, universal studios, and walt disney not including some of the independent film makers who are also interested in us showing there films.

heres how the site will layout
Premiers - we plan to show online premiers of blockbuster movies and independent films, these will only be available to a select group of people and will be a hidden section on the site ie. competition holders, press holders, etc.
Box office - any movie that is in the cinema will be in the box office category, with individual servers for each country, we can time the releases for 30 days after there cinema releases
Movies - this will contain pretty much every movie that is on DVD and bluray from major releases to small independent film makes, there will also be a showcase section for independent film makers who want to show there films, movies will also include the choice to watch online or purchase via digital download.
Soundtracks - that's right we plan to allow users to listen to there favorite soundtracks from the movie with a built in media play you can play samples of your songs or purchase via digital download the full album or the choice to purchase an individual song.
News section will have sub sections so you can view all the latest entertainment news, trailers, posters and soundtrack tasters for everybody to view.
Store - here can buy DVDs, blurays, digital downloads, you can also sell or trade in your old DVDs, blurays, for either online store credit (also allowed to purchase membership as well) or for cash whic will be transferred via bank account, paypal, google checkout.
